Dodge Attack is a minimalist survival game.
Use WASD to move a green circle around the screen.
Avoid two blue balls that bounce off the edges and a purple “AI Predator” ball that actively chases you.
Pick up the yellow turbo power-up and press Space to double your speed for a short burst.
Beware: the blue balls speed up over time, making survival increasingly challenging.
Try to last as long as possible and beat your high score.
Good luck and have fun!
